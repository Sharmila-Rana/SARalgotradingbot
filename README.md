## SAR Algo Trading Bot

This project implements an automated trading bot that fetches **live OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)** data from the Binance exchange, analyzes it using various technical indicators, and places orders based on pre-defined strategies.

### Key Features

1. **Live OHLCV Data from Binance**
   - Utilizes Binance’s REST API to fetch historical OHLCV data for a given trading pair (like BTCUSDT) and interval.
   - The data is processed into a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.
   - A WebSocket connection is used to continuously receive live market data and update the DataFrame in real-time.

2. **Parabolic SAR Trading Strategy**
   - Implements the **SAR (Stop and Reverse)** strategy using the **TA-Lib** library.
   - The strategy tracks the price movement of the asset and places buy/sell orders based on the Parabolic SAR values.
   - Includes triggers for automatic execution of market orders based on live SAR signals.

3. **Multiple Technical Strategies**
   - Supports various technical strategies including:
     - **SMA Crossover**: Uses two Simple Moving Averages to detect buy/sell signals when they cross over.
     - **RSI Strategy**: Utilizes the Relative Strength Index (RSI) to detect overbought and oversold conditions.
     - **Combined MA and RSI Strategy**: Combines moving averages and RSI for more refined trade signals.
   - Strategies are implemented using the **Backtesting.py** framework, allowing historical testing of strategies on the fetched OHLCV data.

4. **Automated Order Execution**
   - The bot interacts with Binance’s testnet API to automatically place buy and sell orders.
   - It calculates HMAC signatures for secure API requests and executes trades based on the trading signals generated by the strategies.
   - Supports both buy and sell market orders with adjustable parameters like quantity and timeframe.

5. **Backtesting and Visualization**
   - The project integrates backtesting using **Backtesting.py**, allowing users to test strategies on historical data before deploying them live.
   - The results of backtests include performance metrics and strategy insights.
   - Visualizes the performance of the strategies using graphs and plots.

### Tools & Technologies
- **Python** for data processing, API interaction, and automation.
- **Pandas** for DataFrame management and OHLCV data analysis.
- **TA-Lib** for technical indicator calculations like **SAR**, **SMA**, and **RSI**.
- **Backtesting.py** for backtesting strategies on historical data.
- **Binance API** for fetching live data and executing trades.
- **WebSockets** for real-time data updates.

### How It Works
1. Fetches historical OHLCV data using Binance's API.
2. Updates the OHLCV data in real-time using WebSocket streams.
3. Uses SAR and other indicators to generate buy/sell signals.
4. Executes market orders automatically through the Binance API.
5. Backtests strategies on historical data for performance evaluation.

This project can be a valuable tool for traders looking to automate their trading strategies based on technical analysis in the cryptocurrency market.
